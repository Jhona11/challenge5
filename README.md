Task Board is a simple Kanban board for managing project tasks. It allows users to organize tasks based on their progress state, set deadlines, and visualize task statuses with color coding.

Features
Task Progress Tracking: View tasks categorized into columns representing different progress states: Not Yet Started, In Progress, and Completed.

Deadline Visualization: Tasks are color coded to indicate their deadline status. Tasks nearing the deadline are highlighted in yellow, while overdue tasks are highlighted in red.

Add New Tasks: Easily define new tasks by clicking the "Add Task" button, which opens a modal dialog to input the title, description, and deadline date.

Task Persistence: Tasks and their properties are saved locally using localStorage, ensuring that they persist even after refreshing the page.

Drag-and-Drop Functionality: Tasks can be dragged and dropped between progress columns to update their progress state.

Delete Tasks: Remove tasks from the task board by clicking the delete button associated with each task card.
